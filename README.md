Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m @WillyHC22

My name is Willy, I am an French engineer graduated with a Master of Engineering in Applied Mathematics from CentraleSuspelec and a MPhil in ECE at HKUST under the supervision of Prof. Pascale Fung, where I have worked on NLP research in the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAiRE).
While I am mainly specialized in Natural Language Processing, the field of machine learning interests me as a whole. Until now, my main research focus has been on dialogue systems and specificially Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems, and more recently Multilingual and Multimodal. Feel free to reach out to me!
